## Adding Bird Images and Audio

### Bird Images

1. Place bird images in the `public/birds/` directory
2. Use kebab-case filenames matching the bird's common name
3. Recommended format: JPG
4. Recommended size: 800x600px (4:3 aspect ratio)

**Filename format:**
- Lowercase
- Replace spaces with hyphens
- Remove apostrophes
- Example: "Morelet's Seedeater" → `morelets-seedeater.jpg`

### Bird Audio Files

1. Place bird call audio files in the `public/audio/` directory
2. Use the same kebab-case naming as images
3. Recommended format: MP3
4. Recommended duration: 5-30 seconds
5. Audio buttons will be automatically disabled if files are missing

**Filename format:**
- Same as images but with `.mp3` extension
- Example: "Morelet's Seedeater" → `morelets-seedeater.mp3`

### Where to Find Bird Media

Here are some excellent resources for bird images and audio:

**Images:**
- [Macaulay Library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) - Cornell Lab of Ornithology
- [eBird](https://ebird.org/) - Global bird database with photos
- [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/) - Free media (check licenses)
- [iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) - Community science platform

**Audio:**
- [Xeno-canto](https://www.xeno-canto.org/) - Free bird sound database
- [Macaulay Library](https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/) - Cornell Lab audio archive

**Important:** Always check and respect the licensing terms for any media you use. Attribute photographers and recordists as required by their licenses.

## Bird Species Database

The app includes bird data for common species found in Belize. Each bird entry includes:
- Common and scientific names
- Family classification
- Habitat preferences
- Physical description
- Size and diet information
- Fun facts
- Observation frequency (when available, based on eBird data)

**Note:** The database is designed to be easily expandable. See the "Adding More Birds" section below for instructions on adding new species.

## Customization

### Adding More Birds

To add more birds to the app, you can use the built-in add-bird skill:

1. **Using OpenCode Skill** (Recommended):
   - The repository includes a custom skill at `.opencode/skills/add-bird/`
   - This skill automates the process of adding birds with images
   - It downloads images, processes them to 800x600, and updates the database
   - See `QUICKSTART.md` for details on using the skill

2. **Manual Method**:
   - Open `src/data/birds.json`
   - Add a new bird object following the existing structure:

```json
{
  "id": 26,
  "commonName": "Bird Name",
  "scientificName": "Genus species",
  "frequency": "X.XX%",
  "family": "Family Name",
  "habitat": ["Habitat 1", "Habitat 2"],
  "description": "Description of the bird...",
  "size": "Very small/Small/Small-medium/Medium/Medium-large/Large",
  "diet": "Nectarivore/Insectivore/Frugivore/Granivore/Omnivore/Carnivore",
  "image": "/birds/bird-name.jpg",
  "audio": "/audio/bird-name.mp3",
  "funFact": "An interesting fact..."
}
```

3. Add corresponding image and audio files to `public/birds/` and `public/audio/`

### Customizing Colors

The app uses Belize-themed colors defined in `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
colors: {
  belize: {
    blue: '#003F87',
    red: '#CE1126',
    green: {
      light: '#86BC42',
      DEFAULT: '#00843D',
      dark: '#004D29',
    },
    sand: '#F4E4C1',
  },
}
```

Modify these to match your preferred color scheme.

## Future Enhancement Ideas

- **LocalStorage**: Save quiz high scores and favorites
- **Dark Mode**: Toggle for light/dark theme
- **Bird Comparison**: View multiple birds side-by-side
- **Location-based**: Filter by region within Belize
- **Advanced Filters**: Size, diet, behavior
- **PWA Support**: Offline functionality
- **Export Results**: Share quiz scores
- **Learning Paths**: Guided tours through bird families
- **Sighting Log**: Track birds you've seen in the wild
